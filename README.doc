Accent "Log" package
====================

This package contains services for common logging operations.


Log service
====================

This service provides mechanisms for logging (acquisation and storing)
arbitrary informations for later analysing.

Multiple "writers" can be attached in logging process to make flexibile
handling of messages with different importances.
Package contains these built-in writers:
 - ErrorLog    - will send messages into oprating system's log files using error_log() function
 - File        - will append message into file
 - FileRotated - similar to "File" but with "log-rotate" capablity
 - Mail        - will send message via email
 - DB          - will store mesage into database table
 - ZendMonitor - will forwarding message to Zend's function zend_monitor_custom_event()

There are 8 levels of importance for log messages. "Minimum level" can be specified for any writer 
so developer can, for example, to send all messages into file but only critical ones to email.

Most writers has option "Buffered" to switch to buffered mode - instead of storing message 
immediately it will wait for end of execution to store all of them in single operation.

Purpose of acquisitors is to attach additional data to each message on-fly.
Package contains these built-in acquisitors:
 - BackTrace    - will append back-trace info to log message
 - Memory       - will append amount of memory usage to log message
 - Request      - will append the most important fields from HTTP request to message



Journal service
====================

"Journal" is classic journalized logger service. 

It uses "File" log writer and contains 3 levels of severity: MAJOR, INFO and DEBUG,
so it will create 3 log files per service.

Journal service stores only messages, no additional data is stored.
